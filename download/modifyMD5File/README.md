Artifactory Modify MD5 File User Plugin
=======================================

This plugin modifies attempts to download `*.md5` files so that a `*.md5.txt` while you have *.md5.txt 
in the path and '*.md5.txt' file is downloaded instead.

In this example works with the `md5-test-repo` repository. (Replace according to your repo you currently want the plugin to function)
