Verifies downloaded files against their asc signature, by using the signature's public key from a public key server (currently using http://keys.gnupg.net). For remote repos, tries to fetch the .asc signature.
Result is cached in the 'pgp-verified' property on artifacts, so that subsequent checks are cheap.
Artifacts that have not been verified will cause a 403 forbidden response to be returned to downloaders.
