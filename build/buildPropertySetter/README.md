Artifactory Build Property Setter User Plugin
=============================================

*This plugin is currently only working in Artifactory 4.x. We are working on updating it to work in Artifactory 5.x.*

Whenever a build is published, the artifacts from the most recent run of the
build are all marked with the property `latest:true`.
