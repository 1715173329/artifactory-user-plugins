Artifactory Before Build Save User Plugin
=========================================

*This plugin is currently only working in Artifactory 4.x. We are working on updating it to work in Artifactory 5.x.*

Whenever a build is submitted, this plugin removes any parameters from the MIME
types of any of the artifacts in the build.
